# WhatIsTheWeatherApp

WhatIsTheWeatherApp is simple wether application which takes its data from https://open-meteo.com/en and presents it in simple format.
With this data the application is programmed to show Brazils and Stockholms current weather by clicking the buttons.

The reason this project had Brazils and Stockholms weather information was to demonstrate the difference between the data gathered.

The time when the video was shot was 9.11.2022 around one o'clock.
